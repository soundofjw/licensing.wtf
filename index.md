# How do I license a cover song?

Licensing a cover song can be confusing. The goal of this info page is to help you understand how to battle the dreadful, "wtf, licensing?"

I show you the three ways to license and sell cover songs, ranging from doing it yourself to using an online licensing platform.

Enjoy!

## bootstrap it / do it yourself (diffiuculty: hard)

* File a request with the publisher via "Notice of Intent" via [section 115](http://www.copyright.gov/licensing/sec_115.html) of the copyright office act. 
  * The original song must have been released as a digital or physical phonorecord in the United States.
  * You only need to file with _one_ publisher via _usps certified mail_.
* Maintain monthly royalty reporting to the publisher.

### Pros

* Cost-effective. Pay for envelopes, mail, and checks.
* Mad props for becoming a do-it-yourself licensing geek!

### Cons

* Time intenstive. Monthly reporting must be accurate. Researching publisher contacts for compositions is time consuming.
* Math. The royalty per copy is 9.1 cents per physical/digital (read: mechanical) copy.

## buy upfront via a licensing service (difficulty: medium)

Use a service like [Loudr Licensing](https://loudr.fm/licensing) to buy licenses up-front from a publisher. These services usually charge a $15 service fee to buy a licenses.

Other alternatives include [Songfile](https://songfile.com).

### Pros

* Bulk licensing discounts exist. Loudr offers up to a $10 per license discount.
* Easier accounting. Only keep track of copies sold, and account against quantity of licenses you pre-paid for.
* Copies are cheap.

### Cons

* Service fees stack up. Not good for starting artists who aren't sure if they'll sell copies.
* Renewal fees are often discounted when your copies expire, but they still exist.
